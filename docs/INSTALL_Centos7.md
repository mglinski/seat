## SeAT - Simple (or Stupid) EVE Online API Tool ##

### Introduction ###
SeAT is a EVE Onlineâ„¢ Corporation / API Key Management Tool written in PHP using the [Laravel][1] Framework. This guide attempts to detail the process in order to successfully get a new installation setup, configured and ready to use. Lets dive right in.

### Requirements ###
Installing SeAT *should* be relatively simple. At a high level, the main requirements for SeAT is:

 - [PHP (5.3+)][2]
 - [Apache][3]
 - [Redis][4]
 - [supervisord][5]
 - [MySQL][6]

SeAT was developed for Linux and has been tested to work fine on CentOS/Ubuntu. Chances are you could get it going pretty easily on many other Linux flavors, so feel free to contribute docs with install guides. As far as windows support goes... well....

### Video Tutorial ###
A visual walkthrough of installing SeAT on CentOS 7 is hosted on asciicinema and can be viewed [here](https://asciinema.org/a/14881). The walkthrough follows the exact same steps as detailed in the below guide, so feel free to follow along. It also shows that you can install SeAT in 16 minutes :D

### Installation Preparation ###
The following guide assumes you are using CentOS 7 and are currently logged in as the `root` user. A separate guide for CentOS 6 / Debian / Ubuntu can be found in `docs/`.
For CentOS 7, the EPEL repository is needed to satisfy the Redis and supervisord dependencies. We will have to add this repository early so lets get to that. Before you add the repository though, check that you have the `wget` command available for use by issuing it with `wget -V`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# wget -V
GNU Wget 1.12 built on linux-gnu.
[... snip ...]
```

If you get a error such as `-bash: wget: command not found`, simply install `wget` using `yum` with `yum install -y wget`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# yum install -y wget
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror

 * updates: dl.za.jsdaav.net

--> Running transaction check
---> Package wget.x86_64 0:1.12-5.el6_6.1 will be installed
```

With `wget` ready to use, we can finally add the EPEL repository:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# wget http://mirror.wbs.co.za/fedora-epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm -O epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm && yum localinstall -y epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm && rm -f epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
```

#### 1. Install & Configure MariaDB ####
Next, we will prepare a MariaDB server instance for SeAT to use. If you already have a database server that you want to use, you may skip the installation section and move on to creating the database and user for SeAT.

##### MariaDB Server #####
*Note* MariaDB is binary compatible with mysql, so many of the commands will say `mysql`. This is not a typo.
So, to install the database server, we run `yum install -y mariadb-server`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# yum install -y mariadb-server
[... snip ...]
--> Running transaction check
---> Package mariadb-server.x86_64 1:5.5.41-2.el7_0 will be installed
--> Processing Dependency: mariadb(x86-64) = 1:5.5.41-2.el7_0 for package: 1:mariadb-server-5.5.41-2.el7_0.x86_64
--> Processing Dependency: perl-DBI for package: 1:mariadb-server-5.5.41-2.el7_0.x86_64
--> Processing Dependency: perl-DBD-MySQL for package: 1:mariadb-server-5.5.41-2.el7_0.x86_64
--> Processing Dependency: perl(Data::Dumper) for package: 1:mariadb-server-5.5.41-2.el7_0.x86_64
[... snip ...]
Installed:
  mariadb-server.x86_64 1:5.5.41-2.el7_0
```

With our MariaDB server installed, we will configure it to automatically start should the server ever reboot with `systemctl enable mariadb.service`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# systemctl enable mariadb.service
ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mariadb.service'
```

Next, we start the database server with `systemctl start mariadb.service`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# systemctl start mariadb.service
```

Lastly, we have to ensure that the database server is secure and that no unauthorized access is possible. MySQL comes shipped with a helper command for that, so we will invoke ith with `mysql_secure_installation`. Make sure you choose a strong MySQL `root` password and remember it:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# mysql_secure_installation

[... snip ...]

Set root password? [Y/n] y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Password updated successfully!

 ... Success!

 [... snip ...]

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

[... snip ...]

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

[... snip ...]

 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

[... snip ...]

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

 [... snip ...]
```

And our MariaDB server installation is done.

##### MariaDB Database and User #####
With a database server ready to use, we will move on to configuring the actual database SeAT will use, along with a user that will access this database.

First, we have to connect to the database server as the `root` MariaDB user with `mysql -uroot -p`. The `-p` will tell the MariaDB client to prompt you for the MariaDB `root` password:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# mysql -uroot -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MariaDB connection id is 10
Server version: 5.5.41-MariaDB MariaDB Server

Copyright (c) 2000, 2014, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MariaDB [(none)]>
```

Next, we create a database for SeAT to use with `create database seat;`:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> create database seat;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

Lastly, we add a MySQL user for SeAT with the `GRANT` statement:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> \q
Bye
[root@seat ~]#
```

The database should now be ready to use!
You can optionally test the connection with the `mysql` client:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# mysql -useat -p #enter your s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd at the prompt
Enter password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

MariaDB [(none)]> \q
Bye

[root@seat ~]#
```

**Note:** Remember the password for the `seat` user as you will need to provide it later when actually installing SeAT itself!

#### 2. Install & Configure PHP / Apache ####
Next we will prepare the web server along with PHP. If you plan on only using the SeAT for backend purposes then you can skip the `httpd` package.

So, lets install the dependencies with `yum install -y httpd php php-mysql php-cli php-mcrypt php-process php-mbstring`

```bash
[root@seat ~]# yum install -y httpd php php-mysql php-cli php-mcrypt php-process php-mbstring
[... snip ...]

```

Next we ensire that the web server will automatically start should our server reboot (can be skipped if `httpd` was not installed) with `systemctl enable httpd.service`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# [root@localhost ~]# systemctl enable httpd.service
ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service'
```

And then lastly, we start Apache with `systemctl start httpd.service`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# systemctl start httpd.service
```

#### 3. Install & Configure Redis ####
The SeAT Jobs system as well as caching occurs in Redis. At present this is the only supported backend for Queues and Cache. So just like we have been installing the other dependencies, we will do the same with `yum install -y redis`:

```bash
root@seat ~]# yum install -y redis

[... snip ...]

--> Finished Dependency Resolution

[... snip ...]

Installed:
  redis.x86_64 0:2.8.14-2.el7

```

Next we enable it to start on boot with `chkconfig redis on`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# systemctl enable redis.service
ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/redis.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/redis.service'
```

And start the Redis Cache with `systemctl start redis.service`

```bash
[root@seat ~]# systemctl start redis.service
```

We now have all the required dependencies to install SeAT! :)

#### 4. Get SeAT ####

##### Preparing Git #####
The SeAT source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/eve-seat/seat) and to get a copy of it, we will need the `git` client. So, first check that you have `git` installed with `git --version`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# git --version
git version 1.8.3.1
```

If you get a error such as `-bash: git: command not found`, simply install it using `yum` with `yum install -y git`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# yum install -y git

[... snip ...]

[... snip ...]

```

##### Getting SeAT #####
Now we finally get to the part of downloading SeAT. This is also the time where you need to decide where you want SeAT to live on your server. I am going to use `/var/www` in the tutorial as the SELinux contexts will be very easy to setup.

So, change directories to `/var/www`:

```bash
[root@seat ~]# cd /var/www/
[root@seat www]#
```

If you check the directory listing with `ls`, you will notice a few folders already present:

```bash
[root@seat www]# ls
cgi-bin  html
```

And finally, clone the SeAT repository from Github with `git clone https://github.com/eve-seat/seat.git`:

```bash
[root@seat www]# git clone https://github.com/eve-seat/seat.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /var/www/seat/.git/
remote: Counting objects: 6080, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (165/165), done.
remote: Total 6080 (delta 87), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (6080/6080), 2.25 MiB | 17 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4132/4132), done.
```

If you have to view the directory listing again now using `ls`, you should notice the new `seat` directory:

```bash
[root@seat www]# ls
cgi-bin  html  seat
```

Change to the new SeAT directory using `cd seat` as we have some installation work to do here. You should be in the directory `/var/www/seat` after the `cd` command. This can be checked with the `pwd` command after the `cd`:

```bash
[root@seat www]# cd seat
[root@seat seat]# pwd
/var/www/seat
```



SeAT is now downloaded and almost ready to start being useful!

#### 5. SeAT Configuration File ####
Some of the SeAT settings need to live in a configuration file. Thankfully, this is not one you have to edit manually, but you do need to provide a sample for the SeAT installer to use later. A sample file lives in `app/config/env-sample.php`, and needs to be copied to `.env.php` in your `seat/` folder. So, while you are still in `/var/www/seat`, copy the sample with `cp app/config/env-sample.php .env.php`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# pwd
/var/www/seat
[root@seat seat]# cp app/config/env-sample.php .env.php
[root@seat seat]#
```

#### 5. The Composer Dependency Manager ####
SeAT relies heavily on [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its internal dependencies. `composer` is a command line tool that should be downloaded separately. Once downloaded, we will have a file called `composer.phar`, which will be executed to update the SeAT dependencies amongst other things.

So, lets install `composer`. We can store the file in the same folder where our `composer.json` lives, which will therefore be `/var/www/seat` (make sure that is the directory you are in before downloading). Then we download `composer` with `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
#!/usr/bin/env php
All settings correct for using Composer
Downloading...

Composer successfully installed to: /var/www/seat/composer.phar
Use it: php composer.phar
```

With `composer` now ready to use, we start the dependency installation with `php composer.phar install` (`composer.phar` is in the same directory as `composer.json` in the below example). Note that this could take some time to complete:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# php composer.phar install
Loading composer repositories with package information

    Downloading: 100%

[... snip ...]

[root@seat seat]#
```

** NEARLY THERE **

#### 5. The SeAT Installer ####
The next step is to invoke the SeAT installer. The installer is responsible for ensuring that the configuration files are correct, the SeAT install has been configured for email and that the database is ready for use.

**Installer Notes:** The installer will only continue once it has successfully made a connection to a MariaDB database and a Redis cache. Please ensure that these have already been configured as per the previous steps.
**Notes about mail:** The SeAT installer will provide you with 3 options for email. `mail`, which will use PHP's mailer, `smtp`, which will prompt you for optional credentials and `sendmail`.

All settings made by the installer may be changed at a later state as they live in the `.env.php` file.
So, lets invoke the installer with `php artisan seat:install`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# php artisan seat:install
[+] Welcome to the SeAT v0.11.0 installer!

[+] Database setup...
[+] Please enter the details for the MySQL database to use (enter to use default):
[?] Username (root):

[... snip ...]
SDE update to rhea-1.0-109013 completed successfully.
[+] Configuring the 'admin' user...
WARNING!!! This will RESET the current Administrator password!

What is the new password to use for the admin user? :
[... snip ...]
[ok] Group Key Manager created.

[+] Done!
```

And thats it :)
If the installer failed, you can safely go and rectify what ever is needed and re-run it.

####  8. Install & Configure supervisord ####
SeAT makes use of *workers* to actually process the update jobs that get scheduled. Think if the architecture as someone coming and dumping mail at the postoffice, and its up to say 4 workers to dig through the mail and sort it. Those 4 workers need a manager to ensure that they keep working. `supervisord` is a excellent candidate for the job.

So lets install supervisord with `yum install -y supervisor`:

```bash
root@seat seat]# yum install -y supervisor

[... snip ...]

---> Package supervisor.noarch 0:3.0-1.el7 will be installed

--> Finished Dependency Resolution

[... snip ...]

Installed:
  supervisor.noarch 0:3.0-1.el7
```

Once it is installed, we also want it to start when the server boots, so lets do that with `systemctl enable supervisord.service`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# systemctl enable supervisord.service
ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/supervisord.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/supervisord.service'
```

We now have to configure the actual workers that `supervisord` will manage. We do this by adding a new configuration file to `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/` called `seat.ini` A sample configuration for this file is located in `docs/` and at the end of this paragraph. Note that the number of workers that we want to start is set by the `numprocs` settings.

```bash
[program:seat]
command=/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan queue:listen --timeout=3600 --tries 1
process_name = %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d
stdout_logfile = /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB
stdout_logfile_backups=10
numprocs=4
directory=/var/www/seat
stopwaitsecs=600
user=apache
```

Once this is done, save the file and start supervisord with `systemctl start supervisord.service`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# systemctl start supervisord.service
```

You can checkup on the status of the workers with `supervisorctl status`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# supervisorctl status
seat:seat-8000                   RUNNING    pid 5083, uptime 0:00:28
seat:seat-8001                   RUNNING    pid 5082, uptime 0:00:28
seat:seat-8002                   RUNNING    pid 5085, uptime 0:00:28
seat:seat-8003                   RUNNING    pid 5084, uptime 0:00:28
```

SeAT should now process jobs that enter the job queue.

####  9. Setup cron ####
While we now have workers ready, and a supervisor for them, we need to configure the part that is responsible for generating the work. SeAT has a preconfigured schedule at which work will come in, however, we need to check every minute if there is work to do. For that we setup a simple cronjob for the web server user with `crontab -u apache -e`, adding the following line to it `* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan scheduled:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# crontab -u apache -e
# paste * * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan scheduled:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
```

#### 10. SELinux #####
Many people hate SELinux, primarily due to a misunderstanding of what it does and how it works. SeAT can run perfectly fine with SELinux enabled, and I actually encourage you to leave it enabled. There is however one small settings change required to make everything work as expected.

First, we have to allow apache to make network connections. This is so that we may connect to the EVEAPI, as well as the MySQL database and Redis cache. Allow this to happen with `setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
[root@seat seat]#
```

Next, we need to allow Apache to write to disk with `setsebool -P httpd_unified 1`

```bash
[root@seat seat]# setsebool -P httpd_unified 1
```

Lastly, we check that all of the SeAT files are labelled correctly so that the SELinux MAC does not incorrectly deny access. We do this with `restorecon -Rv /var/www/seat`:
```bash
[root@seat seat]# restorecon -Rv /var/www/seat
[root@seat seat]#
```

Done! :)

#### 11. Web Server ####
In order to get the SeAT fronted running, we need to configure Apache to serve our SeAT installs `public/` folder.
The Apache configuration itself will depend on how your server is set up. Generally, virtual hosting is the way to go, and this is what I will be showing here.

If you are not going to use virtual hosting, the easiest to get going will probably to symlink `/var/www/seat/public/` to `/var/www/html/seat` and configuring apache to `AllowOverride All` in the `<Directory "/var/www/html">` section. This should have SeAT available at http://hostname/seat after you restart apache.

##### The VirtualHost setup #####
Getting the virtual host setup is as simple as creating a new configuration file (I usually call it the domain.conf), and modifying it to match your setup. Everywhere you see `seat.local`, it needs to be substituted to your actual domain:

First we will prepare SeAT. We create the directory `/var/www/html/seat.local` with `mkdir /var/www/html/seat.local`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# mkdir /var/www/html/seat.local
[root@seat seat]#
```

Next we symlink the SeAT public directory there with `ln -s /var/www/seat/public /var/www/html/seat.local/seat`.

```bash
[root@seat seat]# ln -s /var/www/seat/public /var/www/html/seat.local/seat
[root@seat seat]#
```

With that done, we continue to configure Apache for our VirtualHost. First we change to the directory `/etc/httpd/conf.d` which will have our `seat.local.conf` configuration file with `cd /etc/httpd/conf.d`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# cd /etc/httpd/conf.d
[root@seat conf.d]#
```

Next, we create the file `seat.local.conf`, pasting the following contents into it:

```bash
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@your.domain
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/seat.local/seat"
    ServerName seat.local
    ServerAlias www.seat.local
    ErrorLog "logs/seat.local-error_log"
    CustomLog "logs/seat.local-access_log" common
    <Directory "/var/www/html/seat.local">
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

With the configuration file ready, we will restart Apache, and check if it sees our new Virtual Host. Restart apache with `systemctl restart httpd.service`:

```bash
[root@seat conf.d]# systemctl restart httpd.service

##### File Permissions #####

SeAT writes logfiles/cachefiles and other temporary data to the `app/storage` directory. That together with the fact that the web content will be hosted by apache means that we need to configure the files permissions to allow SeAT do do its thing.

First, lets ensure that apache owns everything in `/var/www/seat` which is the folder we downloaded SeAT to with `chown -R apache:apache /var/www/seat`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# chown -R apache:apache /var/www/seat
[root@seat seat]#
```

Next, we will allow Apache to write to the `app/storage` directory so that it may manipulate the files in there as needed with `chmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/app/storage`:

```bash
[root@seat seat]# chmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/app/storage
[root@seat seat]#
```

SeAT *should* now be available at http://seat.local/seat

##### Logrotate #####
SeAT logs a large amount of internals to 3 main log files:

   - `app/storage/logs/laravel.log`
   - `app/storage/logs/pheal_access.log`
   - `app/storage/logs/pheal_error.log`

Over time, these logs may explode in size (see [this](https://github.com/eve-seat/seat/issues/216)). While not a requirement for SeAT, it is however recommended that you setup logrotate for the log files. A sample configuration that you can dump into `/etc/logrotate.d/` is:

```bash
/var/www/seat/app/storage/logs/*.log {
    monthly
    missingok
    rotate 12
    compress
    notifempty
    create 750 apache apache
}
```

Ensure the path matches where you installed SeAT, and the user `apache apache` matches the user your web server is running as.
